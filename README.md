# Bayesian Logistic Regression

### Linear and Bayesian regression

This repository is set up for the comparison of two approaches to statistical inference in ethnobotany:

In *linear regression* data sampled from a population is considered to be random and the population parameter values are considered fixed (but unknown), known as *null hypothesis*. To estimate that *null hypothesis* we look for the sample parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data known as *p-value*. If we get very small p-value we tend to reject the null hypothesis. 

The methods proposed in *Bayesian regression*, in contrast, provide probabilities in an attempt to quantify the uncertainty about a certain hypothesis, but requires the use of a *prior* belief about how likely this hypothesis is to be true. The method then derives the probability of this hypothesis after seeing the data known as *posterior probability*.
